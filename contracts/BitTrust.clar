;; Title: BitTrust DeFi Lending Protocol
;;
;; Summary:
;; An innovative Bitcoin-secured lending ecosystem that rewards financial 
;; responsibility through adaptive risk assessment and reputation-based pricing.
;;
;; Description:
;; BitTrust revolutionizes decentralized finance by creating a merit-based lending 
;; platform where borrowers earn better terms through proven repayment history.
;; Our sophisticated algorithm adjusts collateral requirements and interest rates 
;; in real-time based on individual reputation scores, fostering a trustworthy 
;; lending environment. Built on Stacks blockchain, it leverages Bitcoin's security 
;; while enabling advanced DeFi functionality through STX token collateralization.
;; The protocol incentivizes responsible borrowing behavior by continuously 
;; rewarding users who demonstrate reliability, creating a self-sustaining 
;; ecosystem of trust and financial opportunity.
